"Local and international data show reduced vaccine protection against COVID-19 infection from around six months after completion of the last vaccine dose in the primary vaccination series or earlier. The level of protection drops even further over time. There is also some reduction in protection against severe disease, particularly in older persons. In addition, international studies have shown that the protection against Omicron variant infection by a primary vaccination series is weaker compared to previous variants, and that boosters increase the protection against infection and severe illnesses caused by Omicron.

To equip households with more ART kits to enable self-testing, MOH is conducting another round of distribution from 22 Oct to 7 Dec 2021. Each household will receive 10 ART self-test kits. Beyond what we have distributed, households who need more kits to perform self-testing are strongly encouraged to purchase them. This is part of our personal and civic responsibility to ensure a safer community for all.",when was the first nationwide distribution of art kits to all households?,28 aug to 27 sep 2021,509,1659
"Self-administered test instructions and requirements vary with the brand of kit you have purchased. Do read the manufacturer's instructions carefully so as to use the ART test kits correctly. For example, any faint test line with a positive Control line is considered positive. To be sure, check against the manufacturer’s instructions. If you have tested positive, you should immediately stop going to work and cancel your social activities to protect others from possibly being infected with COVID-19. Self-isolate for 72 hours at home. This will allow you to safely recover, monitor your health and avoid spreading the virus further. There is no need for an MC if you have no symptoms. If a doctor has assessed you to have a mild condition, you will be given an MC to cover the expected period of rest needed for your symptoms to resolve.
