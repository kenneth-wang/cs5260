"Fully vaccinated and recently recovered individuals travelling to Singapore can produce their professionally administered ART or PCR test result dated within 7 – 90 days before their trip to Singapore, to be exempted from border measures. Click here  for more details. MOH does not issue separate Recovery Memos (RM) for persons placed on Protocol 2 (no/mild symptoms, low risk). Those who test positive for COVID-19 on a self-administered ART can visit a Combined Test Centre (CTC) or Quick Test Centre (QTC) to undergo a supervised ART and have their results documented – such results of infection as supervised at the CTC/QTCs can be used as proof of recovery for exemption from Singapore’s border measures.&nbsp; All travellers are encouraged to refer to the relevant destination countries’ border measure requirements before committing to their travel plans, as they are ultimately responsible for ensuring that they fulfil the border measure requirements of their destination countries.&nbsp;","What documents can I use to show that I have recovered from COVID-19 for travel purposes?",899,904
"Individuals who are fully-vaccinated in Singapore may obtain a digital vaccination certificate (‘Vaccination HealthCert’). The requirements to be considered fully-vaccinated can be found at this link . Digital vaccination certificates are not issued for vaccinations done overseas. For Singpass users Singpass users can obtain their Vaccination HealthCerts by logging in to the Notαrise portal using their Singpass app or Singpass credentials. Upon successful application, the digital vaccination certificate will be sent to the user’s email and Singpass app in approximately 15 minutes. Those eligible for a Singpass account can register for a Singpass account here. Users will be able to access the relevant vaccination records the day after creation of your Singpass account. For Long-term Pass holders Long-term Pass holders will need a valid pass to obtain their Vaccination HealthCert using their Singpass app or Singpass credentials. Long-term pass holders are recommended to obtain their Vaccination HealthCert early, as they will lose access to Singpass upon expiry or cancellation of their pass. If your pass was canceled after 22 Feb 2022, you are given a grace period of 3 months after pass cancellation to obtain your Vaccination HealthCert using your Singpass app or Singpass credentials. For people who are not eligible for Singpass People who are not eligible for a Singpass account, or whose pass has expired and no longer have access to Singpass, may obtain their Vaccination HealthCert from Notαrise using their passport number and dates of vaccination recorded in the NIR.&nbsp; If your vaccination records were tagged to your FIN number which you no longer have, you may need to submit a request to associate your records to you passport number at https://go.gov.sg/health-cert-query . Processing time for the query is about 2–4 weeks.","Who can obtain the digital vaccination certificate (‘Vaccination HealthCert’) for travel overseas?",869,874

Both the original overseas vaccination document and translated document must be brought along when visiting a private healthcare provider in Singapore for serology testing. After arriving in Singapore, the individual will need to visit a healthcare provider who will do the following:  Review the individual’s overseas vaccination documentation - either the original hard copy vaccination certificate or digital vaccination certificate (with translated document where applicable). Perform a serology test. If you have a digitally verifiable vaccination certificate, you may not need to take a serology test (see subsequent questions for details). Update the individual’s overseas COVID-19 vaccination record(s) to NIR as long as the individual (i) has overseas COVID-19 vaccination documentation, and (ii) whose serology test result is positive. Individuals will see their vaccinations status on TraceTogether or HealthHub app within 24 hours after clinic has notified NIR of their overseas COVID-19 vaccination records.","Who can get their overseas COVID-19 vaccination records ingested into the National Immunisation Registry (NIR) and what must they do?",855,860

For those who received the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine as their third vaccine dose as part of a three-dose primary vaccination series incorporating the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccines, they should receive a booster dose of a mRNA vaccine under the National Vaccination Programme earlier - from three months after the third dose of the vaccine, due to lower antibody levels generated by the third vaccine dose. This booster dose should not be delayed beyond nine months after the primary vaccine course. Persons who had recovered from COVID-19 infection and completed the recommended COVID-19 vaccination may receive a booster vaccination. It is safe for them and may provide additional protection. They may receive their next vaccine dose 28 days after infection, although they are recommended to do so three months from the infection and around five months after the last dose of their primary vaccination series (whichever is later) for better effectiveness. *The primary vaccine course may comprise of either:  Two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or the Moderna/Spikevax COVID-19 vaccine; Two or more doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccines as part of a three-dose primary vaccination series; or A complete primary vaccination regimen of other WHO EUL vaccines.

Such persons who received an mRNA vaccine as their third dose should receive the booster dose about five months thereafter. However, those who received the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine as their third vaccine dose should do so at three months thereafter, due to lower antibody levels generated by the third vaccine dose. Persons who were fully vaccinated with other WHO EUL vaccines are also recommended to receive a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine about five months after completion of their primary series vaccination. *Recommendations for Sinovac-Coronavac should similarly apply to Sinopharm","Should persons who had completed the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine three dose primary series receive a booster?

"Yes. You may visit a healthcare provider for your serology test to ingest your records into the NIR. If you received a dose of a non-inactivated virus vaccine (i.e. vaccines except Sinovac, Sinopharm, and Covaxin), you will need to take an anti-N serology test to confirm your past infection in addition to an anti-S serology test to confirm your vaccination. If you received a dose of an inactivated virus vaccine, an anti-N serology test would be unable to ascertain your past infection. You should provide documentary evidence of your past infection to the doctor (e.g. PCR test result, recovery memo).","I previously contracted COVID-19.
