Those who test positive for COVID-19 on a self-administered ART can visit a Combined Test Centre (CTC) or Quick Test Centre (QTC) to undergo a supervised ART and have their results documented – such results of infection as supervised at the CTC/QTCs can be used as proof of recovery for exemption from Singapore’s border measures.&nbsp; All travellers are encouraged to refer to the relevant destination countries’ border measure requirements before committing to their travel plans, as they are ultimately responsible for ensuring that they fulfil the border measure requirements of their destination countries.&nbsp;","What documents can I use to show that I have recovered from COVID-19 for travel purposes?",899,904
"Individuals who are fully-vaccinated in Singapore may obtain a digital vaccination certificate (‘Vaccination HealthCert’). The requirements to be considered fully-vaccinated can be found at this link . Digital vaccination certificates are not issued for vaccinations done overseas. For Singpass users Singpass users can obtain their Vaccination HealthCerts by logging in to the Notαrise portal using their Singpass app or Singpass credentials. Upon successful application, the digital vaccination certificate will be sent to the user’s email and Singpass app in approximately 15 minutes. Those eligible for a Singpass account can register for a Singpass account here. Users will be able to access the relevant vaccination records the day after creation of your Singpass account. For Long-term Pass holders Long-term Pass holders will need a valid pass to obtain their Vaccination HealthCert using their Singpass app or Singpass credentials. Long-term pass holders are recommended to obtain their Vaccination HealthCert early, as they will lose access to Singpass upon expiry or cancellation of their pass. If your pass was canceled after 22 Feb 2022, you are given a grace period of 3 months after pass cancellation to obtain your Vaccination HealthCert using your Singpass app or Singpass credentials. For people who are not eligible for Singpass People who are not eligible for a Singpass account, or whose pass has expired and no longer have access to Singpass, may obtain their Vaccination HealthCert from Notαrise using their passport number and dates of vaccination recorded in the NIR.&nbsp; If your vaccination records were tagged to your FIN number which you no longer have, you may need to submit a request to associate your records to you passport number at https://go.gov.sg/health-cert-query .

For those who received the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine as their third vaccine dose as part of a three-dose primary vaccination series incorporating the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccines, they should receive a booster dose of a mRNA vaccine under the National Vaccination Programme earlier - from three months after the third dose of the vaccine, due to lower antibody levels generated by the third vaccine dose.

Such persons who received an mRNA vaccine as their third dose should receive the booster dose about five months thereafter. However, those who received the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine as their third vaccine dose should do so at three months thereafter, due to lower antibody levels generated by the third vaccine dose.

"Local and international data show reduced vaccine protection against COVID-19 infection from around six months after completion of the last vaccine dose in the primary vaccination series or earlier. The level of protection drops even further over time. There is also some reduction in protection against severe disease, particularly in older persons. In addition, international studies have shown that the protection against Omicron variant infection by a primary vaccination series is weaker compared to previous variants, and that boosters increase the protection against infection and severe illnesses caused by Omicron. As such, booster vaccination is crucial to ensure continued protection against COVID-19.","Why is there a need for a booster dose?",845,850

We can therefore apply a unified approach to managing COVID-19 cases, whether they are of the Omicron or Delta variant.&nbsp; Most travellers coming into Singapore are fully vaccinated and hence, less likely to be infected with COVID-19. Even if infected, they are less likely to become severely ill and impose a burden on our healthcare system. They are therefore well able to recover on their own, be it in-situ at hotels, or in their own homes.&nbsp; To continue to ensure the safety of other guests and hotel staff, MOH and NEA have put in place infection prevention and control guidelines which hotels should adhere to in order to minimise the risk of transmission. Hotels can further protect their guests and staff by streamlining their processes to be contactless as much as possible and taking necessary precautions (such as hand hygiene, frequent cleaning and disinfection of spaces, and adhering to the appropriate SMMs). Staff who are cleaning rooms which were occupied by Ag+/C+ guests should don the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)*.
